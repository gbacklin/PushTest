Launch Keychain Assistant from your local Mac and from the login keychain, filter by the Certificates category. You will see an expandable option called “Apple Development Push Services”

Expand this option then right click on “Apple Development Push Services” > Export “Apple Development Push Services ID123”. Save this as apns-dev-cert.p12 file somewhere you can access it.

Do the same again for the “Private Key” that was revealed when you expanded “Apple Development Push Services” ensuring you save it as apns-dev-key.p12 file.

These files now need to be converted to the PEM format by executing this command from the terminal:
openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -out apns-dev-cert.pem -in apns-dev-cert.p12
openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out apns-dev-key.pem -in apns-dev-key.p12

If you wish to remove the passphrase, either do not set one when exporting/converting or execute:
openssl rsa -in apns-dev-key.pem -out apns-dev-key-noenc.pem

Finally, you need to combine the key and cert files into a apns-dev.pem file we will use when connecting to APNS:
cat apns-dev-cert.pem apns-dev-key.pem > apns-dev.pem

cat apns-dev-cert.pem apns-dev-key-noenc.pem > apns-dev.pem
